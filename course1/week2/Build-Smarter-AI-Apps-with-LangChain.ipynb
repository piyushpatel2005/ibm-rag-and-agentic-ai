      "**How Does AI Work?**\n",
      "\n",
      "AI systems use complex algorithms and machine learning techniques to analyze data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions. They can be trained on large datasets to learn from experience and improve their performance over time. This enables AI systems to:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Recognize patterns**: AI can identify patterns in data, such as images, speech, or text, and use this information to make predictions or classify objects.\n",

      "1. **Input Layer**: This is where the network receives data. Each node in the input layer corresponds to a feature in the input data.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Hidden Layers**: These layers perform computations and transfer information from the input nodes to the output nodes. A neural network can have multiple hidden layers, making it 'deep' - this is known as a Deep Neural Network (DNN).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Output Layer**: This layer provides the final output of the network. The number of nodes in the output layer corresponds to the number of possible outcomes.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Artificial Neurons (Nodes or Perceptrons)**: These are the basic computing units of the neural network. Each neuron receives one or more inputs, performs a computation on those inputs, and then sends the output to other neurons. The computation typically involves a weighted sum of the inputs followed by an activation function.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Connections (Edges or Synapses)**: These are the links between neurons. The strength of the connection between two neurons is represented by a weight. The output from one neuron is multiplied by this weight before it is passed to the next neuron.\n",

      "3. **Layers**: Neural networks are organized into layers:\n",
      "   - **Input Layer**: This is the first layer that receives the external data.\n",

      "   - **Hidden Layers:** These layers perform computations and feature extraction. A neural network can have multiple hidden layers, making it 'deep' (hence the term Deep Learning).\n",
      "   - **Output Layer:** This layer produces the final output or prediction based on the computations performed in the hidden layers.\n",

An AIMessage illustration  \\nC. Prompt Template  \\nPrompt templates  [10] allow you to structure  input for LLMs. \\nThey provide a convenient way to format user inputs and \\nprovide instructions to generate responses. Prompt templates \\nhelp ensure that the LLM understands the  desired context and \\nproduces relevant outputs.  \\nThe prompt template classes in LangChain  are built to \\nmake constructing prompts with dynamic inputs easier. Of \\nthese classes, the simplest is the PromptTemplate.  \\nD. Chain  \\nChains  [11] in LangChain refer to the combination of \\nmultiple components to achieve specific tasks. They provide \\na structured and modular approach to building language \\nmodel applications. By combining different components, you \\ncan create chains that address various u se cases and \\nrequirements.  Here are some advantages of using chains:  \\n• Modularity: Chains allow you to break down \\ncomplex tasks into smaller, manageable \\ncomponents. Each component can be developed and \\ntested independently, making it easier to maintain \\nand update the application.  \\n• Simplification: By combining components into a \\nchain, you can simplify the overall implementation \\nof your application. Chains abstract away the \\ncomplexity of working with individual components, \\nproviding a higher -level interface for developers.  \\n• Debugging: When an issue arises in your \\napplication, chains can help pinpoint the \\nproblematic component. By isolating the chain and \\ntesting each component individually, you can \\nidentify and troubleshoot any errors or unexpected \\nbehavior . \\n• Maintenance: Chains make it easier to update or \\nreplace specific components without affecting the \\nentire application. If a new version of a component \\nbecomes available or if you want to switch to a \\ndiffer.  \\nTo build a chain, you simply combine the desired components \\nin the order they should be executed. Each component in the \\nchain takes the output of the previous component as input, \\nallowing for a seamless flow of data and interaction with the \\nlanguage model.  \\nE. Memory  \\nThe ability to remember prior exchanges conversation is \\nreferred to as memory  [12]. LangChain includes several \\nprograms for increasing system memory. These utilities can \\nbe used independently or as a part of a chain.  We call this \\nability to store information about past interactions \"memory\". \\nLangChain provides a lot of utilities for adding memory to a system. These utilities can be used by themselves or \\nincorporated seamlessly into a chain.  \\nA memory system must support two fundamental \\nactions: reading and writing. Remember that each chain has \\nsome fundamental execution mechanism that requires \\nspecific inputs. Some of these inputs are provided directly by \\nthe user, while others may be retrieve d from memory. In a \\nsingle run, a chain will interact with its memory system twice.  \\n1. A chain will READ from its memory system and \\naugment the user inputs AFTER receiving the initial \\nuser inputs but BEFORE performing the core logic . \\n2. After running the basic logic but before providing the \\nsolution, a chain will WRITE the current run\\'s inputs \\nand outputs to memory so that they may be referred \\nto in subsequent runs.  \\nAny memory system\\'s two primary design decisions are:  \\n1. How state is stored ?  \\nStoring: List of chat messages: A history of all chat \\nexchanges is behind each memory. Even if not all of \\nthese are immediately used, they must be preserved \\nin some manner. A series of integrations for storing \\nthese conversation messages, ranging from in -\\nmemory lists to persistent databases, is a significant \\ncomponent of the LangChain memory module.  \\n2. How state is queried  ? \\nQuerying: Data structures and algorithms on top of \\nchat messages: Keeping track of chat messages is a \\nsimple task. What is less obvious are the data \\nstructures and algorithms built on top of chat \\nconversations to provide the most usable view of \\nthose chats . \\nA simple memory system may only return the most \\nrecent messages on each iteration. A slightly more \\ncomplicated memory system may return a brief summary of \\nthe last K messages. A more complex system might extract \\nentities from stored messages and only retur n information \\nabout entities that have been referenced in the current run.  \\nThere are numerous sorts of memories. Each has its own set \\nof parameters and return types and is helpful in a variety of \\nsituations.  \\nMemory Types:  \\n• ConversationBufferMemory  allows for saving \\nmessages and then extracts the messages in a \\nvariable.  \\n• ConversationBufferWindowMemory  keeps a list of \\nthe interactions of the conversation over time. It only \\nuses the  last K interactions. This can be useful for \\nkeeping a sliding window of the most recent \\ninteractions, so the buffer does not get too large . \\nThe MindGuide chatbot  uses conversation buffer memory.  \\nThis memory allows for storing messages and then extracts \\nthe messages in a variable.  \\nIII. ARCHITETURE  \\nIn crafting the architecture of the MindGuide app, each \\nstep is meticulously designed to create a seamless and \\neffective user experience for those seeking mental health \\nsupport.  The user interface, built on Streamlit, sets the tone \\nwith a friendly and safe welcome. Users can jump in by typing Welcome! to your therapy session. I\\'m here to listen, \\nsupport, and guide you through any mental health \\nchallenges or concerns you may have. Please feel free \\nto share what\\'s on your mind, and we\\'ll work together \\nto address your needs. Remember, this is a safe and \\nconfidential space for you to express y ourself.

    "\n",
    "Chains solve a fundamental problem with LLMs. Chains are primarily designed to handle a single prompt and generate a single response.

    "**Note:** While both approaches are presented here for educational purposes, **LCEL is the recommended pattern for new development.** The SequentialChain approach continues to be supported for backward compatibility, but the LangChain community has largely transitioned to the LCEL pattern for its superior flexibility and expressiveness.\n"
